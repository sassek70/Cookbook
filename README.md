# Phase-3-Cookbook

This React.js and Ruby application was created as my Phase-3 project at Flatiron School. 
The goal of the project was to create a Ruby API with a React.js frontend and utilizing Sinatra for Client-Server communication.

This project was to simulate a cookbook/pantry. The envisioned final project would allow users to see ingredients that they have in their pantry, as well as a master list of all ingredients in the database.
It would allow the user to have a cookbook of recipies and show what they can make based on the ingredients in their pantry and when they cook a recipe, it would automatically adjust the ingredient quantities in their pantry.

Due to time constraints, the project currently has multiple, seeded users, as well as seeded ingredients and recipies. You can see all ingredients and recipies associated with a user. You can also add ingredients/recipies to 
a User's pantry/cookbook. When a new item is added, it is also added to the master list of ingredients and recipies for all users to see. If an item is deleted from a user, that item remains in the master list.
